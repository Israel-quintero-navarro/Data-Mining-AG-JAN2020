## Geometr√≠a de las graficas

### with the information that was presented to us on class using the dataset movies we will test plot funcion with diferente geometries.

#### geom_point(), geom_line()

#### geom_bin2d ()
```R
divides the plane into rectangles, counts the cases in each rectangle 
and then by default maps the number of each case to fill the rectangle.
```

#### geom_hex()
```R
divides the plane into hexagons, count the houses in each of the hexagons and 
then by default maps each one as a fill, hex helps us avoid some of the alignment errors generated by geom_bin2d ().
```

#### geom_polygon()
```R
at the beginning each of the points are connected and later filled with color, 
aesthetic determines what is going to be connected in a polygon.
```

#### geom_rug()

```R
It is a compact visualization designed as a complement to other forms of plotting in 2d
it is preferable to use them with cases where the information is little.```
